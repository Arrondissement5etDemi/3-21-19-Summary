abstract = {There has recently been extensive interest in the nature of the melting/freezing transition for a two-dimensional system of molecules interacting with Lennard-Jones 6:12 potentials, which is a prototype for physisorbed systems. We have therefore made a detailed study of the thermodynamics of the phase diagram for this system. We first made calculations using liquid-state perturbation theory for the fluid state and a self-consistent cell theory for the solid state to determine thermodynamic functions; these results led to ordinary first-order phase transitions between solid/fluid and liquid/gas phases, in agreement with the constant-pressure Monte Carlo results of Abraham. We refined the calculations by using constant-pressure and constant-density Monte Carlo results to improve the accuracy of the calculated free energies, and we determined the two-phase equilibria by making direct Monte Carlo calculations for two-phase systems. The results are internally consistent and lead to a phase diagram qualitatively similar to the three-dimensional Lennard-Jones system. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

@article{Morrison1973,
abstract = {Numerical values of reduced second and third virial coefficients and their temperature derivatives are reported for a two-dimensional gas, for use in interpreting adsorption isotherms of monolayers on isoenergetic substrates. Correct values of the third virial coefficient have not been available before. Examples of earlier treatments of adsorption data are given to demonstrate that values of the higher virial coefficients are essential for adequate discussions of adsorption isotherms. When these are used the high-temperature adsorption isotherms of argon on graphitized carbon black in the monolayer region are completely described in terms of the unperturbed bulk-gas parameters. {\textcopyright} 1973.},
